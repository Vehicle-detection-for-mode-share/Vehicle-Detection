# Vehicle Detection for Google Street View Images: Characterizing Mode Share Using Computer Vision

The objectives of this project are two-fold:

1. Create, train, test and tune a deep learning model to achieve high sensitivity and specificity for counting vehicles in Google Street View images
2. Use the model to count vehicles across several major cities in the World

## Research Output

So far, this project has potential for the following outputs:

1. GSV vehicle counts ranking of 73 cities for motorcycling and cycling
2. Detailed comparison: GSV vehicle counts versus control travel or census data for motorcycling and cycling in a small number of cities

## Getting Started

Here is a list of the items contained in this repository:

- **[Data-Preparation](https://github.com/Vehicle-detection-for-mode-share/Vehicle-Detection/tree/master/Data-Preparation)**: folder containing code for the data preparation process

- **[Model-Build](https://github.com/Vehicle-detection-for-mode-share/Vehicle-Detection/tree/master/Model-Build)**: folder containing code for the creation, training and tuning process of the deep learning model

- **[Mode-Share](https://github.com/Vehicle-detection-for-mode-share/Vehicle-Detection/tree/master/Mode-Share)**: folder containing statistical analyses assessing model's ability to characterize mode share
